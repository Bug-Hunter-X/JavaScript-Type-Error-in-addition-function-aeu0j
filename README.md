This repository contains a JavaScript code example demonstrating a common runtime error: attempting to perform arithmetic operations on non-numeric values.  The `foo` function adds two arguments, but doesn't explicitly check for numeric types before addition. This results in a `TypeError` if either `a` or `b` isn't a number. The solution demonstrates how to safely handle this case using type checking.
